    <p class="mb-4 text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
      This decentralized application (DApp) was built as a technical showcase to demonstrate integration with Web3
      technologies using Angular 20, TailwindCSS, and MetaMask SDK. It features a modular architecture, responsive design,
      and modern UI components, reflecting best practices in frontend and blockchain development.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
      The primary goal of this project is to highlight my skills as a Fullstack Developer, including smart contract
      interaction, wallet connectivity, and performance optimization. It serves as a public portfolio artifact to support
      my job search and professional growth.
